# Student Management System

A simple **Python-based project** designed to manage student records efficiently. This system provides basic functionalities like adding, updating, deleting, and viewing student details in an organized way. It is ideal for beginners who want to practice **CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** and learn how to handle data in Python.
